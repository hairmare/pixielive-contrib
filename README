this contains my scripts for working with the gentoo based pixielive distro for gma500/poulsbo type netbooks

mainly this repo contains MAKEFILE for the tasks i've 
faced sofar. Most of this is based on the great work 
of <INSERT)MAINTAINER_NAME_HERE>. In fact the <SCRIPTNAME>
script is more or less his, with some simple cleanup to
make the script more bashy and less linear.

Most of this release aims at providing some crucial 
packages that are missing from the main pixielive distro.

I have taken some time to upgrade my system to a decent state
as to be able to compile against the same version as pixielive 
uses. Some of the libe are rather dirty and there is some USE
flag mismatching going on. The most stable lzm I can offer for 
now is the lastfm one, keep in mind though, that is was compiled
with USE=-ipod though.
