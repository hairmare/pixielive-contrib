scripts for working with the gentoo based pixielive 

pixielive http://http://www.pixielive.org is a distro for 
gma500/poulsbo type netbooks. It ships with gnome and is
quite fully featured while still being rather zippy. It
is based on gentoo and linux-live from http://www.linux-live.org/ 

This repo contains a MAKEFILE for the tasks I've 
faced so far. Most of this is based on the great work 
of Christian Lorandi. In fact the InstallProgrammaInRoot
script is his. 

Most of this release aims at providing some packages that I
missed from the distro. Some of them are probably pretty exotic.

It took quite some time to upgrade my system to a reasonable state
and to be able to compile against the same versions pixielive uses. 
Some of the libs are rather dirty and I have some USE flag mismatches. 

The most stable lzm I can offer for now is the lastfm one. Keep 
in mind that is was compiled with USE=-ipod.
